Proposition
===========
In the age of ubiquitous Internet access and automated information processing any secret will eventually leak.

Demonstration
-------------
While I’m unable to provide a formal version of the statement above, nor a formal demonstration of if – you are therefore invited to try to demonstrate or refute it – I can outline a sketch of a possible proof.

First, the probability of a secret leaking is a strictly increasing functions of:
1.	The number of subjects that know the secret
2.	The number of subjects that may have access to the secret
3.	The time the secret is kept
